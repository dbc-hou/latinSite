      <h2>Latin for the End of the World?</h2>
      <p>The global climate is going bonkers, and we have very little time to act toward preventing destruction
      on an almost-unimaginable scale.</p>
      <p>Civilization is collapsing, along with the unraveling of vital institutions and social norms.</p>
      <p>And in the back of your mind, a voice is saying, <em>Y'know, I've always wanted to learn Latin.
      There isn't much time left, so I'd better get started.</em></p>
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <p>This site began as an attempt to write a Latin textbook for language geeks, home-schoolers, auto-didacts,
      and others to teach themselves the Latin language—or at least a good portion thereof. It is also designed
      to be somewhat entertaining—or, at least, not as dry as most Latin texts.</p>
      <p>This site also envisions a world in which at least two of civilization's great historical sins are
      abolished: imperialism and sexism, along with all the other -isms that cause or result from them.</p>
      <p>Roman civilization was built on conquest of surrounding territories, the exploitation of the labor of
      conquered peoples, and the extraction of those lands' natural resources. Modern humans would like to
      believe that we have outgrown all that, but imperialism/colonialism is still very much a feature in
      today's social, economic, and political systems.</p>
      <p>On a smaller scale, Rome was one of many cultures in the Mediterranean region that embraced oppression
      of women. From its founding in the eight century B.C.E. through its collapse 1200 years later, Rome
      never allowed women to play anything but supporting roles. Women who achieved any recognition for
      accomplishments in the arts, the sciences, politics, or other pursuits were rare indeed. (Roman women
      did not even have names of their own—just feminine versions of their clan names; a man named Caelius
      might have several daughters, all named Caelia.)</p>
      <p>However, to boycott the Latin language just because Rome was an ultra-sexist, hyper-imperialist
      culture would mean missing the larger point. It's a quite literally awesome language in so many ways,
      and remnants of it are found in languages spoken today all over Europe and beyond. Writing an English
      paragraph without some Latin-derived words would be difficult indeed. The best way to develop a robust
      English vocabulary is by studying Latin (and adding a little ancient Greek certainly doesn't hurt).
      That vocabulary enables you to learn more about the world around you, making it easier to determine
      what parts of it need fixing and how one might fix them.</p>
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>We haven't created a fictitious Roman family, like the one found in the <em>Ecce Romani</em> series.
      We didn't hire an illustrator to draw typical Romans, or even shell out a few bucks
      for stock images to decorate these lessons. (We might provide links to pictures here and there.)
      We don't have elaborate Latin dialogs or narrative paragraphs to introduce or conclude each lesson.</p>
      <p>Instead, we've tried to pare the vocabulary and grammar down to the fundamentals and injecting occasional
      snarky commentary and semi-useful trivia to keep things lively. You are allowed to giggle at the
      pronunciations of Latin words like <strong>faciō</strong>, and we'll giggle right along with you.</p>
      <p>OK, by <em>we</em>, I of course mean <em>I</em>. I don't have a whole editorial staff here; it's
      just me and my MacBook and valuable online resources like <a href="https://wiktionary.org">Wiktionary</a>.</p>
      <p>Each lesson starts with some vocabulary, mostly lists of words that have something in common.
      In some lessons you may also find related words or phrases to give the vocabulary an extra dimension—
      <em>e.g.</em>, when you learn the noun <strong>equus</strong> (<em>horse</em>), you may also learn
      the related adjective <strong>equīnus</strong> (<em>horselike, horse-related</em>), whence comes
      the English derivative <em>equine</em>.</p>
      <p>We are also assiduous in helping you distinguish among words that appear similar but whose meanings are
      unrelated. For example, the English words <em>equal</em> and <em>equity</em> have nothing to do with
      <strong>equus</strong>; they come from the adjective <strong>aequus</strong>, meaning <em>fair, just, equal</em>.
      (During the Medieval Era, the <strong>ae</strong> diphthong in <strong>aequus</strong> devolved
      into a simple <strong>e</strong>.)</p>

      <h3>Exercises and Eccentricity</h3>
      <p>Most of the lessons end with an Exercise section. The questions or tasks in the exercises sometimes appear
      in ascending order of difficulty or complexity, but sometimes they don't. But they are all geared toward
      getting the user to think through the task. Sometimes you will find yourself <em>overthinking</em> through it,
      but <em>that's OK!</em> When you see that the answers are different from yours, you'll learn something—
      not just about Latin, but about your own thinking process.</p>
      <p>By the way, if your answer isn't exactly the same as the answer given, that's normal. This is not an
      exact science. The relationship between Latin vocabulary and its English equivalents is not one-to-one; it's
      many-to-many. So you might choose a different word from what is expected. We will try to account for all
      possible correct answers, but there's no guarantee.</p>
      <p>Quite a few of the sentences you're asked to translate from Latin to English are,
      well, a little weird—<em>i.e.</em>, not sentences one would ever expect to hear in conversation
      today or when Latin was more widely spoken. That's intentional! Sometimes it results from not having
      the right combinations of words already introduced to make sensible sentences, but mostly it's because
      the vocabulary is not the most important part of the learning. What we're testing is whether you can
      recognize what roles the nouns play in the sentences, based on their endings. (Do whuuuut now? You can
      learn more about the importance of endings in <a href="IntroD.html">Part D of the Introduction</a>.)</p>
      <p>A brief note about sex: Your average high school Latin book likely wouldn't make any references to
      sex or sexuality. This site does, although not gratuitously or graphically. The vocabulary on this site
      does include words such as <strong>coitus</strong>, which has meanings other than sexual intercourse.
      Suppression of sexuality has led to mass societal neurosis and is linked with oppression of women
      and transgender humans. We'll have none of that here. If you'd like to learn some common Latin words and
      phrases related to sex, skip to the last chapter...which, as of this writing, has not yet been written.</p>
      <p><em>To be completed eventually...</em></p>
