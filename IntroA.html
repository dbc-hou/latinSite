      <h2>A. Why Latin?</h2>
    <p>Unlike some other ancient languages such as Sanskrit, literally nobody has spoken Latin as a native language for more than a millennium. Outside of the Vatican City, there are few people in the world who can speak it as a second or third language. Learning to speak Latin could make you the star at a party with an above-average nerdiness quotient, especially if you encounter somebody else there who can converse in it.</p>
      <p>Speaking Latin fluently is absolutely <strong>not the goal</strong> here. The main goals are</p>
    <ol>
        <li>to build your English vocabulary, and</li>
        <li>to make it easier to learn the Romantic languages that evolved from Latin; these include French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, Romansch, Spanish, and dozens of local variants of these languages.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Treasures and Pleasures of Latin Literature</h3>
    <p>An auxiliary goal, if you discover that you have a passion for the language,
      is the ability to read ancient Roman or more recent Roman Catholic writings
      in the original language. Certainly, you can derive great pleasure from reading
      translations of the poetry of Ovid (Publius Ovidius Nāsō), for example.
      But there are many different English translations because there are so many ways
      certain words and phrases can be translated.
      If you can read the original text—or, more accurately, what the Medieval monastic
      transcribers determined to be the original—you can choose (or even create)
      the translation that works best for you!</p>
    <h3>Those College Aptitude Tests</h3>
    <p>Bulking up one's English vocabulary with a dose of Latin is an excellent
      strategy for secondary school students preparing to take their
      college entrance exams, as well as anyone who aspires to a career in law,
      medicine, or any of the sciences. Future physicians and research scientists
      would also benefit from learning the Greek root words relevant to their
      disciplines.</p>
    <h3>Humanities Majors Need Latin Too</h3>
    <p>Even if you just plan to major in literature, however, Latin can help you
      in reading and understanding the writings of centuries past.
      European poets, novelists, and essayists of the 18th and 19th centuries
      were mostly well-educated men and women, and being well-educated included
      being immersed in Latin; this immersion comes through in their writings—not
      only in their choice of words, but also in the structure of their
      sentences, which could be quite different from the way people speak
      in real life. The language is intentionally artificial because, as American
      novelist Charles Bukowski said, fiction is meant to be an <em>improvement</em>
      on real life.</p>
    <p>Those studying the history of Europe in depth might also want to add
      some Latin to their scholarly tool chests. When a major historical figures
      like Martin Luther, for example, wrote anything important, they might
      write it in Latin (even though Luther was a big advocate of getting Bibles
      printed in "modern" languages for the masses to read more easily).
      <strong>Magna Charta</strong> (Latin for <em>the Great Sheet of Papyrus</em>) was written
      in—you guessed it—Latin, rather than the not-yet-standardized English
      of the 13th century.</p>
    <h3>Inflection in Modern Languages</h3>
    <p>Beyond strengthening one's vocabulary, a bit of Latin can go a long way
      toward learning non-Romantic languages from Europe and elsewhere.
      As we shall explore later in this introduction, Latin is an <em>inflected</em>
      language. This means not only that verbs have <em>conjugations</em> that follow
      certain rules (most of the time), but that nouns, pronouns, and adjectives
      have <em>declensions</em>.</p>
    <p>In Latin, a noun doesn't have just one singular and one plural form
      as in English, French, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish; it can take any of
      several forms depending on its role in a sentence. In the sample sentence
      below, each noun plays a different role:</p>
    <blockquote class="border border-1 border-dark p-1 m-1">
      <em><strong>Hey Publius, the general's son sold my nephew his farm in Gaul.</strong><br/>
    Hey [direct address], the [possessor]'s [subject] sold my [indirect object]
        his [direct object] in [place where].</em></blockquote>
    <p>In Latin, each of the six roles would appear in a different <em>case</em>.
      The endings attached to the nouns indicate their cases,
      and the cases indicate the nouns' functions (or at least provide clues).</p>
    <p>German, Hungarian, Finnish, and the various Slavic languages are just a few
      modern examples of languages that attach various endings to their nouns
      and adjectives. Romanian is the only major Romantic language with vestiges
      of declension passed down from its linguistic ancestor.</p>
    <h3>Lastly, Why Not?</h3>
    <p>There are worse hobbies one could take up than learning a semi-extinct
      language. You don't have to be a language nerd to plow through this text,
      but it couldn't hurt. There are bound to be a few dozen folks out there
      thinking, "The world is coming to an end, the people in charge of it
      aren't doing a great job preventing it—in fact, they're hastening it—so
      I may as well learn some Latin."</p>
    <p>If that is the case, let us hope that this do-it-yourself Latin course
      will keep you entertained while you wait for the Apocalypse.</p>
